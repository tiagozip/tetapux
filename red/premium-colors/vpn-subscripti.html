        <p><strong>Action Required: Don’t Delay!</strong></p>
        <p>We urge you to take a moment right now to renew your UltraV VPN subscription. It’s a simple process that ensures you’ll continue enjoying all the benefits you’ve come to love. Simply click the button below to get started and keep your online presence protected and thriving:</p>
        <a href="#" class="button">Renew Now</a>
        
        <p>Here’s a friendly heads-up: if you don’t renew within the next 7 days, your account will automatically shift into what we call “Unprotected Explorer” mode. In plain terms, that means you’ll lose access to all the fantastic VPN features that have kept you secure so far. We’d hate to see you miss out on the protection and freedom UltraV provides, so let’s make sure that doesn’t happen. Renew today, and keep exploring the internet with confidence and security!</p>
